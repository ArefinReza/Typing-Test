        "When many vehicles are stuck or move slowly on the road, it’s called a traffic jam. It’s common in major cities and towns, caused by various reasons. Drivers often don’t know or follow traffic rules. Vehicles of different speeds on the same road can cause congestion. Reckless driving and accidents add to the problem. Roads are too narrow for the increasing number of cars. Rainy seasons make it worse with water clogging."

        "Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea. In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.",
        "Topic sentences are similar to mini thesis statements. Like a thesis statement, a topic sentence has a specific main point. Whereas the thesis is the main point of the essay, the topic sentence is the main point of the paragraph. Like the thesis statement, a topic sentence has a unifying function. But a thesis statement or topic sentence alone doesn’t guarantee unity. An essay is unified if all the paragraphs relate to the thesis, whereas a paragraph is unified if all the sentences relate to the topic sentence. Note: Not all paragraphs need topic sentences.",

        "Traffic jams happen a lot on roads and highways, making things inconvenient and frustrating for drivers and passengers. They occur when vehicles slow down or stop because of accidents, construction, congestion, or bad weather. One big reason for traffic jams is congestion. This happens when there are too many vehicles on the road, especially during busy times like rush hour or big events."
